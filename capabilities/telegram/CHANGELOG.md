## 2026-10-08 — The store setting is read from the family's file

`telegram` now uses `capabilities-contract` 0.2.0, which reads the machine's store setting from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agentkit/store.json`, the file `capabilities store set` now writes, and from the manager's former files while it is absent; `AGENTKIT_STORE_URL` overrides it ahead of `CAPABILITIES_STORE_URL`. A machine whose setting is in the former files behaves as before.
